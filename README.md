HackTube is an YouTube clone project that replicates the platform's core functionalities and familiar interface. 
The project incorporates user authentication with login and registration capabilities, along with a customizable profile page. The main page displays 16 videos fetched from a YouTube API, featuring an intuitive tag filtering system that allows users to sort content by specific categories. When users select a tag, the interface dynamically updates to show only videos matching that category, making content discovery more efficient and personalized. 
Users can watch individual videos, like them, and track their viewing history. The platform maintains a history page that logs all watched content for easy access. HackTube also enables content uploading through the post page, where users can add videos using URLs. The intuitive navigation and search system mirrors YouTube's layout, making it easy for users to find and interact with content. The profile section allows users to edit their personal information and update their profile picture, creating a personalized experience within the platform.
